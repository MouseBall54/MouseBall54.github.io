Hello! Today, I want to take you on a deep dive into the key features of **Easy Labeling**, a powerful image annotation tool designed to revolutionize the process of creating object detection datasets.

Optimized especially for the YOLO format, Easy Labeling focuses on streamlining the user's workflow with a rich set of features that make the repetitive task of labeling faster, easier, and more accurate.

## 1. Seamless Local Environment with No Server Needed

One of the most significant advantages of Easy Labeling is its ability to work directly with files on your computer **without requiring any server setup or file uploads**. By leveraging the modern File System Access API, it securely accesses local folders to read and save images and label files.

-   **High-Speed Performance:** Eliminates upload and download times, allowing you to process large datasets quickly.
-   **Robust Security:** All data is handled exclusively on your machine, ensuring that sensitive information remains private and secure.

## 2. Intuitive and Powerful Annotation Tools

Easy Labeling is equipped with all the essential tools for precise and rapid annotation.

-   **Flexible Bounding Box Editing:** Intuitively draw bounding boxes with your mouse, resize them by dragging edges or corners, and easily move or delete them.
-   **Precision Control:** Freely zoom in and out, pan across the image to examine details, and get real-time coordinate displays for high-precision work.
-   **Drawing/Edit Mode Toggling:** Boost your efficiency by quickly switching between drawing and editing modes with the `Ctrl+Q` shortcut.

## 3. UI/UX Designed for an Efficient Workflow

The interface is intelligently designed to help you focus purely on the task at hand.

-   **Maximized Workspace:** Adjust the size of the side panels or collapse them completely to get a wider, unobstructed view of the image.
-   **Image Preview Bar:** The thumbnail bar at the bottom provides a complete overview of your dataset, allowing you to navigate to any image instantly.
-   **Real-Time Sync:** Selecting a box on the canvas highlights the corresponding label in the side panel, and vice versa, keeping your view perfectly synchronized.
-   **Powerful Filtering:** Systematically work through your dataset by filtering images that are unlabeled or contain specific classes.

## 4. Smart Label Management

Go beyond simple annotation with advanced features for managing your dataset systematically.

-   **Load Class Names from YAML:** Import a class definition file (like `data.yaml`) to manage labels with human-readable names such as 'car' or 'person' instead of numeric IDs like '0' or '1'.
-   **Bulk Actions:** Minimize repetitive tasks by selecting all boxes of a specific class at once or changing the class of multiple selected boxes simultaneously.

## 5. Productivity-Boosting Convenience Features

-   **Dark Mode:** Work comfortably for extended periods with a sleek, eye-friendly dark mode.
-   **Auto-Save:** Your progress is automatically saved to prevent any accidental data loss.
-   **Extensive Shortcuts:** Maximize your speed with a wide range of keyboard shortcuts for actions like navigating images (A/D), copy/paste (Ctrl+C/V), and more.

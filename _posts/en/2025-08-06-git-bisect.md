## What is `git bisect`?

`git bisect` is a powerful debugging tool in Git. It helps you find the specific commit that introduced a bug by performing an automated binary search through your project's commit history. 

Instead of manually checking out and testing each commit one by one, `git bisect` quickly narrows down the search space, making the process much faster and more efficient.

## Problem Scenario

You know that your application was working correctly a week ago, but now a feature is broken. You have hundreds of commits between the last known good state and the current broken state. Finding the exact commit that caused the issue would be very time-consuming.

## Solution: Using `git bisect`

Hereâ€™s how to use `git bisect` to find the problematic commit.

### 1. Start the Bisect Process

First, you need to start the bisect session. 

```bash
git bisect start
```

### 2. Mark the Bad and Good Commits

Next, you need to tell Git two things:
-   A "bad" commit where the bug is present.
-   A "good" commit where the bug is not present.

Usually, the current commit (`HEAD`) is the bad one.
```bash
git bisect bad HEAD
```

Then, you provide the hash or tag of a commit that you know was working correctly.
```bash
git bisect good <commit_hash_or_tag>
# Example:
git bisect good v1.0.0
```

### 3. Test and Repeat

Once you've marked the good and bad commits, `git bisect` will check out a commit halfway between them. It will then say something like:

```
Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
```

Now, you need to test your code at this commit to see if the bug exists.
-   If the bug **is present**, tell Git this commit is "bad":
    ```bash
    git bisect bad
    ```
-   If the bug **is not present**, tell Git this commit is "good":
    ```bash
    git bisect good
    ```

Git will then check out another commit, again halfway between the new good and bad boundaries. You repeat this process of testing and marking commits as `good` or `bad`.

### 4. Identify the First Bad Commit

After a few steps, Git will have narrowed down the possibilities to a single commit. It will print a message like this:

```
c1a2b3d is the first bad commit
commit c1a2b3d
Author: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 5 10:00:00 2025 +0000

    Refactor the login module

... file changes ...
```

This is the commit that introduced the bug. You can now examine its changes to understand what went wrong.

### 5. End the Bisect Session

Once you have found the bad commit, you should end the bisect session to return to your original state (`HEAD`).

```bash
git bisect reset
```

## Automating the Process

You can even automate the testing step if you have a script that can determine whether the code is good or bad (e.g., a test suite).

The `git bisect run` command takes a script as an argument. Git will run the script on each step. 
-   If the script exits with code `0`, the commit is marked `good`.
-   If it exits with any other code (between `1` and `127`, except `125`), it's marked `bad`.

```bash
# Example: using a test script
git bisect run npm test
```

## Conclusion

`git bisect` is an incredibly useful tool for quickly tracking down regressions in your codebase. By automating the search for a bug-introducing commit, it saves you a significant amount of time and effort in the debugging process.

The `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error is a common issue for developers using the Fetch API in JavaScript. It's a generic error message that indicates a network request failed to complete. The cause can range from simple network connectivity problems to more complex server-side configurations like CORS.

This guide will walk you through the most common causes and how to resolve them.

### What Causes "Failed to fetch"?

This error appears in the browser's console when a `fetch()` request is initiated but cannot be completed. The browser doesn't receive any response from the server. Key reasons include:

1.  **Network Connectivity Issues**: The most basic cause is a lack of internet connection or a firewall blocking the request.
2.  **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policy**: This is the most frequent culprit. The server you are requesting data from does not permit your domain to access its resources.
3.  **Incorrect URL or DNS Issues**: The URL might be misspelled, or the domain name cannot be resolved by DNS.
4.  **Blocked Request**: The request might be blocked by the browser itself (e.g., mixed content blocking) or by a browser extension (like an ad blocker).
5.  **Server Not Responding**: The server at the specified URL might be down or unresponsive.

### How to Fix "Failed to fetch"

Let's break down the troubleshooting steps.

#### Step 1: Check Your Network Connection and the URL

Before diving into code, verify the basics:
- Are you connected to the internet?
- Is the server you're trying to reach online? You can test this by pasting the API URL directly into your browser's address bar.
- Did you spell the URL correctly in your `fetch()` call? Check for typos in the domain, path, or protocol (http vs. https).

#### Step 2: Investigate CORS Issues

If the basics check out, the problem is likely CORS. A "Failed to fetch" error due to CORS means the server rejected the request before sending a response because the origin of the request (your web page) is not on its list of allowed origins.

**How to check for CORS issues:**
Open your browser's developer tools (F12), go to the **Console** tab. You will often see a more descriptive error message accompanying "Failed to fetch," such as:

`Access to fetch at '...' from origin '...' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`

**Solution (if you control the server):**
You need to configure your server to include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its responses. This header tells the browser which origins are permitted to access the server's resources.

For a Node.js/Express server, you can use the `cors` middleware:

```bash
npm install cors
```

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// Allow all origins
app.use(cors());

// Or, allow a specific origin
// app.use(cors({
//   origin: 'https://your-frontend-domain.com'
// }));

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Success!' });
});

app.listen(3001, () => console.log('Server is running'));
```

**Solution (if you DON'T control the server):**
If you are using a third-party API, you cannot change its server-side CORS policy. The standard solution is to create a proxy server. Your application sends the request to your own server, which then makes the request to the third-party API and forwards the response back to your application. Since the server-to-server request is not subject to browser CORS policies, this approach works around the issue.

#### Step 3: Check for Mixed Content

Browsers block requests for HTTP resources from a page that was loaded over HTTPS. This is called "mixed content" blocking. Ensure that if your site is on `https://`, your API requests are also made to `https://` endpoints.

#### Step 4: Disable Browser Extensions

Temporarily disable any ad blockers or privacy-related browser extensions to see if they are interfering with the network request.

### Conclusion

The "Failed to fetch" error is a broad network-related error that requires systematic troubleshooting. Start with the simplest explanations—network connectivity and URL typos—before moving on to more complex issues like CORS policies. In most web development scenarios, a misconfigured CORS header on the server is the primary cause.

## What are Generics?

Introduced in Java 5, **Generics** allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different data types while providing compile-time type safety. Instead of using the generic `Object` type and performing manual casts, you can specify the type that a class or method will work with. This is indicated by the angle bracket notation `<>`.

### The Problem Before Generics

Before generics, collections like `ArrayList` stored everything as an `Object`. This meant you could add any type of object to a collection, leading to potential `ClassCastException` errors at runtime.

**Pre-Generics Code (Unsafe):**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("hello");
list.add(123); // No error at compile time

// This will compile, but throw a ClassCastException at runtime
String text = (String) list.get(1); 
```
To find this bug, you had to run the program. The compiler couldn't help.

## The Solution: Generics for Type Safety

Generics solve this problem by allowing you to specify the type of elements a collection can hold.

**Code with Generics (Type-Safe):**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); // This list can ONLY hold Strings
list.add("hello");
// list.add(123); // This is now a COMPILE-TIME ERROR!

String text = list.get(0); // No cast needed
```

The compiler now enforces that only `String` objects can be added to the list. This catches bugs early and eliminates the need for manual casting.

### Key Concepts of Generics

#### 1. Generic Classes and Interfaces

You can create your own classes and interfaces that are generic. The type parameter (commonly `T` for Type, `E` for Element, `K` for Key, `V` for Value) acts as a placeholder.

**Example of a Generic Class:**
```java
// A generic Box class that can hold any type of object
public class Box<T> {
    private T content;

    public void setContent(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}

// Usage
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
stringBox.setContent("A string");
String myString = stringBox.getContent();

Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
integerBox.setContent(42);
int myInt = integerBox.getContent();
```

#### 2. Generic Methods

You can also create a generic method that has its own type parameter. This is useful for static utility methods.

```java
public class Utils {
    // A generic method to print array elements
    public static <E> void printArray(E[] inputArray) {
        for (E element : inputArray) {
            System.out.printf("%s ", element);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}

// Usage
Integer[] intArray = { 1, 2, 3 };
String[] stringArray = { "A", "B", "C" };

Utils.printArray(intArray);   // Prints 1 2 3
Utils.printArray(stringArray); // Prints A B C
```

#### 3. Bounded Type Parameters (Wildcards)

Sometimes you want to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments. This is done using the `extends` keyword.

- **Upper Bounded Wildcard (`? extends Type`)**: The unknown type is a subtype of `Type`. This is useful when you want to *read* from a generic structure.

```java
// This method can take a List of Number or any of its subclasses (Integer, Double, etc.)
public void processNumbers(List<? extends Number> list) {
    for (Number num : list) {
        System.out.println(num.doubleValue());
    }
    // list.add(1); // COMPILE ERROR: You can't add to an upper-bounded list
}
```

- **Lower Bounded Wildcard (`? super Type`)**: The unknown type is a supertype of `Type`. This is useful when you want to *write* to a generic structure.

```java
// This method can take a List of Integer or any of its superclasses (Number, Object)
public void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> list) {
    list.add(10);
    list.add(20);
    // Object item = list.get(0); // You can only safely read as Object
}
```

The mnemonic **PECS** (Producer Extends, Consumer Super) helps remember when to use which wildcard.

### Key Takeaway

Generics are a cornerstone of modern Java programming. They provide strong type checking at compile time, eliminate the need for explicit casts, and allow developers to write more reusable and robust code. Always use generics with collections and consider creating your own generic classes and methods to improve the quality of your code.
